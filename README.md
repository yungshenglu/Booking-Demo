## Implementation

### Components

- All components are implemented without any third-party UI library.
- The styles of components are implemented with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) which is a library designed for writing css styles with JavaScript. In short, it is an styled-component design.

### Long-Press Function in Button

- The long-press function is implemented via `setInterval` to detect whether the action of clicking button in long-press in `CustomButton`.
  - You can adjust the interval of long-press arbitrary.
- To implement long-press action, we also need these **synthetic events** as follow in React:
  - `onMouseDown`
  - `onMouseUp`
  - `onMouseLeave`
  - `onTouchStart`
  - `onTouchEnd`

### Factory Design
